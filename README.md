### Monty Python and the Code Writer

I had the intention of writing this program on 05/03/2023 but wisdom told me to put it on hold. It'd be one of my first projects written in this IDE and using a Python framework but i'm going to put it on hold until around June/July since I scheduled two certifications, one for Salesforce JS Dev 1 and another for AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. The tests are 3 days apart and This project will be on hold until then.

## Intention

My intention is to get familiar with the language, hearing that it is a very high level language with a desirable syntax. My major goal is to familiarize myself with the OpenAI API and then use it for another project, namely Sonarous. The current repository will be a functioning code writer based on the AI platform. After learning the syntax of Python I will consider either writing the next program in TypeScript (preferred) or writing it with the newly acquired Python skills.
